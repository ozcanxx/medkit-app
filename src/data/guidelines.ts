// Clinical practice guideline registry for the medkit-attending grading agent.
//
// Each entry is sourced directly from the publishing society's website
// (NICE, BTS, ESC, ADA, AHA, IDSA/ATS, etc.). Recommendation `text` fields
// are reproduced verbatim from the public guideline page; classification
// metadata (`recClass`, `lev`, GRADE) is only set when the source page
// explicitly states it.
//
// Every entry here is `verificationStatus: "auto-fetched"` until a
// clinician has reviewed the wording and confirmed accuracy. Do not flip
// any entry to `"verified"` from code — that is a human-MD sign-off only.
//
// `lastVerified` is the ISO date the page was retrieved by the curator
// agent (not necessarily the guideline publication date — see `year`).
//
// Citation format used by the grading agent:
//   `${guideline.id}:${rec.recId}`
// e.g. "nice-ng136-htn-2019:ng136-1.4.32-step1-acei-arb"
